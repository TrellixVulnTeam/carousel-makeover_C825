One or more CSS/GSS files must be supplied as inputs.
Output will be written to standard out unless --output_file is specified.

command line options:
 --allow-def-propagation                : Allows @defs and @mixins from one
                                          file to propagate to other files.
 --allow-unrecognized-functions         : Allow unrecognized functions.
 --allow-unrecognized-properties        : Allow unrecognized properties.
 --allowed-non-standard-function VAL    : Specify a non-standard function to
                                          whitelist, like alpha()
 --allowed-unrecognized-property VAL    : Specify an unrecognized property to
                                          whitelist
 --const                                : Specify integer constants to be used
                                          in for loops. Invoke for each const,
                                          e.g.: --const=VAR1=VALUE1 --const=VAR2
                                          =VALUE2
 --copyright-notice VAL                 : Copyright notice to prepend to the
                                          output
 --css-renaming-prefix VAL              : Add a prefix to all renamed css class
                                          names.
 --define VAL                           : Specifies the name of a true condition
                                          . The condition name can be used in
                                          @if boolean expressions. The condition
                                          s are ignored if GSS extensions are
                                          not enabled.
 --excluded-classes-from-renaming VAL   : Pass the compiler a list of CSS class
                                          names that shoudn't be renamed.
 --gss-function-map-provider VAL        : The fully qualified class name of a
                                          map provider of custom GSS functions
                                          to resolve.
 --input-orientation [LTR | RTL]        : This specifies the display orientation
                                          the input files were written for. You
                                          can choose between: LTR, RTL. LTR is
                                          the default and means that the input
                                          style sheets were designed for use
                                          with left to right display User
                                          Agents. RTL sheets are designed for
                                          use with right to left UAs. Currently,
                                          all input files must have the same
                                          orientation, as there is no way to
                                          specify the orientation on a per-file
                                          or per-library basis.
 --output-file (-o) VAL                 : The output CSS filename. If empty,
                                          standard output will be used. The
                                          output is always UTF-8 encoded.
 --output-orientation [LTR | RTL |      : Specify this option to perform
 NOCHANGE]                              : automatic right to left conversion of
                                          the input. You can choose between:
                                          LTR, RTL, NOCHANGE. NOCHANGE means
                                          the input will not be changed in any
                                          way with respect to direction issues.
                                          LTR outputs a sheet suitable for left
                                          to right display and RTL outputs a
                                          sheet suitable for right to left
                                          display. If the input orientation is
                                          different than the requested output
                                          orientation, 'left' and 'right'
                                          values in direction sensitive style
                                          rules are flipped. If the input
                                          already has the desired orientation,
                                          this option effectively does nothing
                                          except for defining GSS_LTR and
                                          GSS_RTL, respectively. The input is
                                          LTR by default and can be changed
                                          with the input_orientation flag.
 --output-renaming-map VAL              : The output from the CSS class
                                          renaming. Provides a map of class
                                          names to what they were renammed to.

 --output-source-map VAL                : The source map output. Provides a
                                          mapping from the generated output to
                                          their original source code location.
 --preserve-comments                    : Preserve comments from sources into
                                          pretty printed output css.
 --pretty-print                         : Whether to format the output with
                                          newlines and indents so that it is
                                          more readable.
 --rename [NONE | DEBUG | CLOSURE]      : How CSS classes should be renamed.
                                          Defaults to NONE.
 --source_map_output_level [ALL |       : The level to generate source maps.

                                          variables and symbol mappings, and
                                          ALL, which outputs mappings for all
                                          elements.
